# Spring Recipes Web Application
A simple recipe application created with help from John Thompson's 
[Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://github.com/springframeworkguru)

## How to run: 
Download and install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and clone this repository to your local 
machine. Create a new project in your favorite IDE, then build and run the project with Maven. Open the application on 
any web browser at the address of your local machine with the port number Tomcat is running on (default 8080).
Ex: localhost:8080

## Features:

A list of all recipes will appear at the root URL (home page). The application will load two recipes on startup.
